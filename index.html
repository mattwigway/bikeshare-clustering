      <p>This represents a clustering of bikeshare trips based on what
      the start and end stations are near, and the relationships
      between them. For instance, a high score on Jobs (10 min)
      indicates that there are more jobs within 10 minutes of the
      start station than the end station. The clustering attempts to
      find patterns in the trips, by grouping similar trips
      together. The hypothesis is that there are several different
      types of trips that bikeshare serves. The pink bars represent
      what percentage of trips in that cluster were made on the
      weekends and by casual users (users with a one- or three-day
      pass, as opposed to an annual membership), respectively. The
      jobs and population within 10 minutes variables represent the
      ratios of the number of jobs and the number of residents, respectively,
      within 10 minutes walking distance of the start and end
      stations. The 30 and 60 minute variables include transit as
      well. The bike stations within 30 minutes variable uses
      bicycling as the mode (as that is how other bike stations would
      be reached) and 30 minutes as the time cutoff because trips
      longer than 30 minutes incur overage charges.</p>

      <p>Clusters 1 and 2 are clearly related, as are clusters 3 and
      4. Cluster 2 is a mirror-image of cluster 1. This is easy to
      explain; the two clusters represent round trips. Since the
      scores represent ratios, return trips will have reversed
      accessibility ratios. The number of trips in clusters 1 and 2
      are also very similar, reinforcing the hypothesis that the
      clusters represent round trips. This argument is not as strong
      for clusters 3 and 4, but they do appear to be related in a
      similar way.</p>

      <p>The trips in clusters 1 and 2 appear to be commute trips;
      they have much higher accessibility to jobs at one end than the
      other. The trips in cluster 3 and 4 represent other types of
      trips. Higher percentages of the trips in these clusters
      (especially cluster 4) are made on weekends and by casual
      users. These trips appear to be driven more by housing, so
      perhaps they represent shopping trips or homebound trips from
      transit stations.</p>

      <p>This analysis suggests that there are distinct types of trips
      and that they are taken by different types of users. This
      information could be useful in planning and operation of
      bikeshare systems. For example, knowing that subscribers make
      more trips from low to high job accessibility areas could
      suggest what the effects will be on the balance of casual users
      and subscribers of a particular station configuration. This
      information could also be used when building models to predict
      how the system will be used. This visualization is descriptive;
      it describes how the system is used, but does not predict
      anything. However, the trends shown could be integrated in a
      predictive model using other tools. Another area of further
      research would be to incorporate additional accessibility
      measures; people may be using bikeshare to access transit or
      shopping, so it would be valuable to calculate how many transit
      stops and retail opportunities are near stations, and use those
      measures for clustering as well.</p>
