      <p>These graphs represent a clustering
      of <a href="http://bayareabikeshare.com/">Bay Area Bike
      Share's</a> trip data by accessibility ratios. Accessibility is
      a measure of how many things are within a certain distance of a
      place, and an accessibility ratio is the ratio of the
      accessibilities at the start and end of the trip. So an
      accessibility ratio of 7:1 for jobs within 10 minutes would mean
      that there are seven times more jobs within ten minutes walking
      distance of the start station than the end station.</p>

      <p>Clustering assigns the trips to groups with similar
      accessibility ratios. The hypothesis is that there are several
      kinds of trips served by bikeshare; for example, commuter trips
      would have large differences in accessibility to jobs at the
      start and end stations (because they are try to access
      employment zones). For each cluster, I also computed the
      percentage of trips that were made by casual users (users
      without an annual membership) and the percentage that were made
      on the weekend, in order to evaluate the meanings of the
      cluster. These other variables were not used to perform the
      clustering, so any differences observed suggest differences in
      trip-making patterns between casual users and subscribers and
      between weekend and weekday trips.</p>

      <p>I created four clusters of trips based on accessibility
      differences, as shown in the graphs above. Bars above the line
      indicate that the start station is more accessible in that
      category, and bars below the line indicate that the end station
      is more accessible. You will note that clusters 1 and 2, and 3
      and 4, are nearly mirror images of each other; this makes sense
      as many people make round trips. For example, a trip from home
      to work would have a very low score for the jobs accessibility
      ratio (because jobs are much more accessible at the end), and
      the corresponding work-to-home trip would have the opposite.</p>

      <p>Clusters 1 and 2 appear to represent commuters; there are
      large differences in the job accessibility between start and end
      stations, while other variables are less important. In clusters
      3 and 4, jobs do not dominate and indeed the differences in
      accessibilty between the start and end of trips is not as
      large. Cluster 4 in particular has high levels of weekend and
      casual trip making, although cluster 3 also has higher levels
      than the commute clusters. This suggests that weekend and casual
      trips have different patterns than commute trips: they are less
      likely to be focused on entering or leaving an employment
      center.</p>

      <p>This information can be used in bikeshare system
      planning. Knowing that different types of users make different
      types of trips can help predict, for example, trip patterns or
      rebalancing needs. Further research could include adding more
      types of accessibility (accessibility to transit stations would
      be useful, as many use bikeshare to access transit; this project
      used accessibility measures that had been computed previously
      and did not include accessibility to transit stations). It would
      also be interesting to cluster the <i>users</i> of a bikeshare
      system by their demographic characteristics to see if different
      groups of people have different trip-making patterns.</p>
